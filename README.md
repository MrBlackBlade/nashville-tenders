 - [x] **Add boundaries to the screen to prevent out of bounds**
 - [x] **Move the player object initializations from main.cpp to Player.cpp**
 - [x] **Function calls in main should match the number of objects (for loop)**
 - [ ] **Add an Object struct similar to Player**
 - [ ] **Change the return of collision() to bool to make conditionals easier**
 - [ ] **When button is pressed, the sprite of the door will animate but the collision will be removed between players and door**
 - [ ] **Decide whether collision( ) returns true or false based on the identifiers of the colliders (enum, obj.id)**
